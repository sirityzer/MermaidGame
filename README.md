1. NEVER COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER!!!!! Make changes on your branch > pull from master > merge master into your branch > push your branch to GitHub. Create pull request to have your changes merged into master.
2. How to add files to repo: make sure whatever you're adding is in the correct folder in your local repo (make sure you're in your branch) 
*add files, make changes, ect.
*in GitKracken there should be a blue bar to the right 	that says "Viwe Change" click that
*Click "Stage all changes"
*give summary & description to commit
*click "Commit changes"
*pull from master 
*merge master into your branch 
*push your branch to GitHub
*go to repo on github.com
*if you want your changes merged into master open pull 	request
